# cot-4500-as3
# This repository contains a requirements.txt file, which lists the requirements to run the main program. The only library needed is numpy. The code contained in cot-4500-as3/src/main/assignment_.py contains the solutions to the two questions from Programming Assingment 3. Question 1 uses Euler's Method to approximate the solution using ten iterations, and Question 2 uses Runge-Kutta Method to approximate the solution to the same equation from Question 1.
# Use the git and clone commands in your Python terminal, followed by the url to my GitHub submission, to run my code.
